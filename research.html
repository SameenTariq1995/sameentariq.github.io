    <h2>PhD Thesis</h2>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Behavioural Interventions in Education and Decision-Making: Evidence from Field and Laboratory Experiments</p>
    <p>This research examines how behavioural and psychological mechanisms shape decision-making and learning outcomes.</p>

    <h3>Paper 1 – “Who’s Teaching the Teachers?”</h3>
    <p>Survey experiment testing whether behaviourally enhanced communication can improve teachers’ willingness to adopt new teaching practices. Using data from over 2,000 teachers across Latin America, India, and Kenya, it finds that clear, benefit-oriented information increases adoption intentions, particularly among female and public-school teachers.</p>

    <h3>Paper 2 – “Can Loss Aversion Be Changed? Evidence from a Resilience Training Experiment”</h3>
    <p>Laboratory RCT examining whether resilience training can reduce loss aversion by improving emotional regulation and cognitive reframing. Results show that resilience training lowers loss aversion (λ), suggesting that it is psychologically malleable and responsive to structured training.</p>

    <h3>Paper 3 – “What Drives Foundational Learning? Experimental Evidence on Instructional and Behavioral Mechanisms”</h3>
    <p>Randomized field experiment in Pakistan’s Merged Areas (FATA) evaluating the impact of instructional supports and behavioural interventions—teacher, parent, and community nudges—on early-grade learning. Parental and community engagement channels significantly improved outcomes, while teacher nudges alone had limited effects.</p>
