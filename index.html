        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a behavioural and experimental economist whose research studies the impact of behavioural interventions on education outcomes and economic decision-making using field and laboratory experiments. My work examines how context-specific behavioural tools—such as nudges, framing, and psychological training—can shape risk preferences and educational outcomes.</p>

        <p>Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Short-Term Consultant with the <strong>World Bank</strong> (SARCE and Sustainable Development teams), a Senior Research Assistant at the <strong>Centre for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP)</strong>, and a Teaching Fellow at <strong>Information Technology University (ITU)</strong>. I currently serve as an Associate Teacher in Economics at the University of East Anglia.</p>
